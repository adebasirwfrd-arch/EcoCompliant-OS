# Domestic Waste Management Audit Guide

This guide ensures compliance and audit readiness for non-hazardous (Domestic) waste management in accordance with Indonesian regulations (e.g., Permen LHK No. 6/2021).

## 1. Waste Categorization
Auditors look for clear segregation and quantification of waste streams.
- **Organic (Organik)**: Food waste, garden waste. Destination: Composting or TPS3R.
- **Inorganic (Anorganik)**: Paper, Plastic, Metal, Glass. Destination: Licensed Recyclers.
- **Residual (Residu)**: Waste that cannot be recycled. Destination: Licensed Landfill (TPA).

## 2. Diversion Rate Calculation
The "God-Tier" dashboard automatically calculates the **Waste Diversion Rate**.
- **Formula**: `(Recycled Weight + Composted Weight) / Total Generated Weight * 100%`
- **Target**: High diversion rates (>30%) are benchmarked for environmental excellence and PROPER Green/Gold targets.

## 3. Partner Verification
All external waste handlers must have valid licenses.
- **Collector/Transporter**: Must have business identification (NIB) and transport permits.
- **Processor (Recycler/TPS3R)**: Must have Environmental Approval (Persetujuan Lingkungan).
- **Landfill (TPA)**: Must be a government-recognized facility.

## 4. Evidence Trail
The **Generation Logs** provide the source data for audit verification.
- **Log Integrity**: Every record should include Date, Category, Weight, and Source.
- **Evidence Vault**: Upload skip-notes (surat jalan) or weight receipts to the Audit Evidence Vault for every transport action.
