# PROPER Audit Readiness Guide

This guide outlines the workflow for achieving and maintaining high PROPER ratings (Green/Gold) using the Environmental Management System.

## 1. Compliance (Blue Rating)
The foundation of PROPER is the "Blue" rating, which signifies full compliance with environmental regulations.

### Key Monitoring Areas:
- **Water Quality**: Regular logging of pH, BOD, COD, and TSS levels.
- **Air Emissions**: Continuous monitoring of stack emissions (CEMS) and integration with SIMPEL.
- **Hazardous Waste (B3)**: Accurate tracking of waste generation, storage, and transport (Festronik integration).
- **Land Protection**: Monitoring soil quality and preventations for land degradation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A "No" fulfillment in any mandatory compliance parameter will result in a **RED** or **BLACK** rating, regardless of innovation scores.

## 2. Beyond Compliance (Green/Gold Rating)
Once compliance is secured, the system triggers the "Beyond Compliance" scoring logic.

### Innovation Parameters:
- **Energy Efficiency**: Implementation of renewable energy and energy reduction programs.
- **Biodiversity**: Protection of local flora/fauna and ecosystem restoration.
- **Global Warming**: Quantifiable absolute reduction in Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions.

## 3. Social ROI (Community Development)
For a **GOLD** rating, a high innovation score must be coupled with impactful social programs.

### Requirements:
- **Innovation Type**: Programs must be categorized as "Social" or demonstrate significant process innovation.
- **SROI Score**: A Social Return on Investment (SROI) score of > 3.0 is recommended for Gold benchmarks.

## 4. Evidence Vault Management
All claims made in the digital dashboard must be backed by evidence in the **Audit Evidence Vault**.

### Required Documentation:
- **RKL-RPL Reports**: Semesterly management and monitoring reports.
- **Calibration Certificates**: For CEMS and lab equipment.
- **SROI Studies**: Third-party verification of social impact.
- **Manifests**: Digital proof of hazardous waste disposal.
